If you use this code and find it helpful, please cite the above paper. Thanks:)
----------------------------------------------------------------

The code is written in MATLAB:
    1) The folder "BGM" contains the functions to perform sparse signal recovery using the proposed PE-GAMP. The input channel is assumed to be Bernoulli-Gaussian mixture (BGM) channel, the output channel is assumed to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel.
        a) "PEGMAMP.m" is the main function to perform PE-GAMP.
        b) "PEGMAMP_sim.m" is a simplified version to estimate the parameters.
        
    2) The folder "main" contains some functions from the GAMP MATLAB package.
    3) The folder "test_images_256" contains several image dataset.
    4) "noiseless_signal_recovery.m" contains examples to perform noiseless recovery.
    5) "image_recovery.m" contains examples to perform image recovery using PE-GAMP.
