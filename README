Remember to set the parameters accordingly for your specific experiments, the code is written in MATLAB:

    1) The folder "BGM" contains the functions to perform sparse signal recovery using the proposed PE-GAMP. The input channel is assumed to be Bernoulli-Gaussian mixture (BGM) channel, the output channel is assumed to be additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel.
        a) "BGM_PE_GAMP.m" is the main function used to perform sum-product PE-GAMP.
        b) "bgm_input_update.m" is the function used to estimate the input channel parameters.
        c) "awgn_output_update.m" is the function used to estimate the output channel parameters using sum-product message passing.
    
    2) The folder "BEM" corresponds to the Bernoulli-Exponential mixture (BEM) input channel and the AWGN output channel.
        a) "BEM_PE_GAMP.m" is the main function used to perform sum-product PE-GAMP.
        b) "bem_input_update.m" is the function used to estimate the input channel parameters.
        
    3) The folder "LP" corresponds to the Laplace (LP) input channel and the AWGN output channel.
        a) "SUM_LP_PE_GAMP.m" is the main function used to perform sum-product PE-GAMP.
        b) "MAX_LP_PE_GAMP.m" is the main function used to perform max-product PE-GAMP.
        c) "sum_lp_input_update.m" is the function used to estimate the input channel parameters.
        
        
    4) The folder "main" contains some functions from the GAMP MATLAB package.
    5) The folder "test_images_256" contains several image dataset.
    6) "XXX_noiseless_signal_recovery.m" contains examples to perform noiseless recovery experiments.
    7) "XXX_image_recovery.m" contains examples to perform image recovery experiments using PE-GAMP.
